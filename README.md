TaskTrayShortcuts
=================

Goal
----

Windows 10 allowed to display the contents of a directory as a submenu of
the taskbar. This feature seems to have disappeared in Windows 11.

The application aims to reproduce this feature.

where `path_to_folder` references the folder which contains shortcuts to
be displayed as submenu in taskbar notification zone.
